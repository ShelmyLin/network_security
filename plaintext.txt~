her is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.t is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.[1][2]The Vigenère (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) cipher has beeeinvented many times. The method was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sigiovan Battista Bellaso; however, the scheme was later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and is nowidely known as the "Vigenère cipher".[citation needed]hough the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for threcenturies it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers.[3] Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher.Contents  [hide]
